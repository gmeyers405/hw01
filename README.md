My name is Gabrielle Meyers, but most people call me Gabby.

## Quick Facts
* I'm a rising third year at the College.
* I'm majoring in Public Policy and History.
* I'm from Long Island, NY, where I currently live with my family and my dog, Ella.

## My Life At School
I lived in Jannotta House in South. I am a copyeditor for the *Maroon* and I also write for the *Gate*. I was an AC for one of the ChoMUN committees before our competition was cancelled due to the coronavirus. Furthermore, I volunteer through Alpha Phi Omega (the community service fraternity) and Supplies for Dreams.

## My Life at Home
I ended up enrolling for this class after being accepted into the **Summer Institute for Social Science Research Methods (SISRM).** In addition to taking this class, I also attend daily workshops while working with a faculty member on their research project. I am taking this class to get better at using R, since I'm currently primarily a Stata user. This summer, among other things, I hope to get better at using several data analysis software systems. In my spare time, I like to read.

## Final Remarks
A few days ago, I didn't even know what forking or committing or pushing meant, and now I feel like I can do it with relative ease. It's only been a couple of days, and I feel like I'm already learning so much. If you are impressed by my coding skills, feel free to endorse my R skills on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielle-meyers-5599a318a/) !
